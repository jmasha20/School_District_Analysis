# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
A school board detects evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders which appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, and to uphold state-testing standards, this analysis will:

 * Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores with NaNs while keeping the data intact.
 * Summarize district metrics
 * Summarize school metrics
 * Top five high and low performing high schools 
 * The average math score for each grade level from each school.
 * The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
 * The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
 
_(For the purposes of this analysis "Initial" (I) means before data clean up and "New" (N) means after data clean up. Data clean up = replaced ninth-grade reading and math scores with NaNs while keeping the data intact. The initial and new data was analyzed between two files to avoid errors.)_


## Resources
-Data Source: 
* Resources/schools_complete.csv  
* Resources/students_complete.csv

-Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Results 
Before the data clean up, the total student count was 39,170; after the data clean up (replaced ninth-grade reading and math scores with NaNs) the new total student count is 38,709. 

### District Summary 
The district summaries below show a difference in math score and math and reading percentage:
 * "Average Math Score" = .1 difference (I- 79.0 to N- 78.9)
 * "% Passing Math" = .2 difference (I- 75% to N- 74.8%)
 * "% Passing Reading" = .3 difference (I- 86% to N- 85.7%)
 * "% Overall Passing" = .1 difference (I- 65% to N- 64.9%)
