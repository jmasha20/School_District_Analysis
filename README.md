# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
A school board detects evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders which appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, and to uphold state-testing standards, this analysis will:

 * Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores replaced with NaNs while keeping the data intact.
 * Summarize district metrics
 * Summarize school metrics
 * The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
 * The average math score for each grade level from each school.
 * The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
 * The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
